>If you are not good at solving more than R1400 in Codeforces, you should learn some algorithms above and solve typical problems in Codeforces. For example, if you felt that you are not good at DP, solve DP-tagged problem in Codeforces which is R1200-R1400. Surprisingly, there are only ~50 problems which tagged DP and less than or equal to R1400.
