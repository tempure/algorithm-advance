Some algorithmic code snippets that I used before, mainly for programming contests. In the past few years, when I was still preparing for the algorithm competition, I summarize the code templates for these algorithms, including the version that can be printed in PDF format, which can be viewed in the old branch and releases.

There are only codes and example problems in the master branch source files now, as well as the latest and constant revisions and additions. The old branch is no longer intended to be maintained. Templates are categorized as follows, for more detailed algorithm classification, you can refer to [here](https://github.com/livrth/cp/blob/master/README.md).

- basic algorithms
- data structures
- dynamic programming
- search algorithms
- math related algorithms
- computational geometry
- graph theory algorithms
- string related algorithms
- miscellaneous in the contest

Since I am no longer participating in algorithm competitions, the code in this repository will only be updated occasionally. If you find any bugs, or have any questions about the usage of template codes, welcome to raise issues or submit pull requests :)
